# Project plan
The goal for this project is to build a travel blog. 

### A list of travel locations
* Build a list of locations you already travelled to
* The following information should be shown:
	* The Name of the city and country
	* When you were there, maybe a from and to date
	* A description what the purpose of the trip was, describe it a bit
	* Be creative, you can add as many information as you want!
* One should be able to remove travel locations
* This list should be read from and written to the local storage

### A form to add travel locations
* A user should be able to add travel locations with the needed information
* You can experiment with the various input elements.
* Make the name and the date of the travel location required. The description can be optional

### Show the current weather of the travel location
* We can fetch the current weather of the travel location using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Show it as one of the information in your travel location
* Dependent on the weather, you could show different icons

### Show a map with its location on a map
Embedding a Google Map with the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) and how to integrate it in your app. You could then show the travel location on a map for every travel location.
